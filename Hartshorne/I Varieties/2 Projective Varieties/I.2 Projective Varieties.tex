\begin{problem}\label{exc:2.1}
  Prove the ``homogeneous Nullstellensatz,'' which says if $\mathfrak{a}
  \subseteq S$ is a homogeneous ideal, and if $f \in S$ is a homogeneous
  polynomial with $\deg f > 0$, such that $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in
  Z(\mathfrak{a})$ in $\PP^n$, then $f^q \in \mathfrak{a}$ for some $q >
  0$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider $S = k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ as an affine polynomial ring, and let
  $CZ(\mathfrak{a})$ be the affine variety defined by $\mathfrak{a}$ in
  $\AA^{n+1}$.
  Then, $f(P) = 0$ for any $P \in CZ(\mathfrak{a})$, since any nonzero $P$ is a
  representative of some point in $Z(\mathfrak{a})$, and if $P=0$ then $f(P) =
  0$ by the fact that $f$ is homogeneous with $\deg f > 0$.
  By the affine Nullstellensatz (Thm.~1.3A), we have $f^q \in \mathfrak{a}$ for
  some $q > 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}\label{exc:2.2}
  For a homogeneous ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq S$, show that the following
  conditions are equivalent:
  \begin{enumi}
    \item $Z(\mathfrak{a}) = \emptyset$ (the empty set);
    \item $\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}} =$ either $S$ or the ideal $S_+ =
      \bigoplus_{d > 0}S_d$;
    \item $\mathfrak{a} \supseteq S_d$ for some $d > 0$. 
  \end{enumi}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  $(i) \Rightarrow (ii)$. If $Z(\mathfrak{a}) = \emptyset$, then
  $CZ(\mathfrak{a}) = \{0\}$ or $\emptyset$, where as in Exercise \ref{exc:2.1}
  $CZ(\mathfrak{a})$ is the affine variety in $\AA^{n+1}$ defined by
  $\mathfrak{a}$.
  If $CZ(\mathfrak{a}) = \{0\}$, then $x_i^r \in \mathfrak{a}$ by the affine
  Nullstellensatz (Thm.~1.3A) for each $0 \le i \le n$, hence $x_i \in
  \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}$ for each $0 \le i \le n$, and so $\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}
  \supset S_+$; this is moreover an equality since $S_0 = k$, and $\mathfrak{a}
  \cap k = \emptyset$ for otherwise $CZ(\mathfrak{a}) = \emptyset$.
  On the other hand, if $CZ(\mathfrak{a}) = \emptyset$, then since $\emptyset =
  Z(S)$ by the proof of Prop.~1.1, then $I(\emptyset) = I(CZ(\mathfrak{a})) =
  \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}} = S$ by Prop.~$1.2(d)$.
  \par $(ii) \Rightarrow (iii)$. If $\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}} = S$, then $1 \in
  \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}$, which implies $1 = 1^n \in \mathfrak{a}$, and so $\mathfrak{a} \supset S_d$ for any $d$.
  On the other hand, if $\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}} = S_+$, then $x_i^r \in
  \mathfrak{a}$ for some $r$ for all $0 \le i \le n$. But every element in
  $S_{r(n+1)}$ has some $x_i^r$ appearing in each term by the pigeon-hole
  principle, and so $\mathfrak{a} \supset S_{r(n+1)}$.
  \par $(iii) \Rightarrow (i)$. $\mathfrak{a} \supset S_d$ implies all $x_i^d$
  must vanish on $Z(\mathfrak{a})$, which is impossible in $\PP^n$, hence
  $Z(\mathfrak{a}) = \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}\mbox{}\label{exc:2.3}
  \begin{enuma}
    \item If $T_1 \subseteq T_2$ are subsets of $S^h$, then $Z(T_1) \supseteq
      Z(T_2)$.
    \item If $Y_1 \subseteq Y_2$ are subsets of $\PP^n$, then $I(Y_1) \supseteq
      I(Y_2)$.
    \item For any two subsets $Y_1,Y_2$ of $\PP^n$, $I(Y_1 \cup Y_2) = I(Y_1)
      \cap I(Y_2)$.
    \item If $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq S$ is a homogeneous ideal with
      $Z(\mathfrak{a}) \ne \emptyset$, then $I(Z(\mathfrak{a})) =
      \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}$.
    \item For any subset $Y \subseteq \PP^n$, $Z(I(Y)) = \overline{Y}$.
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  $P \in Z(T_2)$ implies $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in T_2$, and so in particular
  $f(P)= 0$ for all $f \in T_1$, hence $P \in Z(T_1)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  It suffices to show the homogeneous elements of $I(Y_2)$ are in $I(Y_1)$,
  since both ideals are assumed to be homogeneous. If
  $f$ is a generator of $I(Y_2)$, then $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Y_2$, and in
  particular $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Y_1$, hence $f \in I(Y_1)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(c)$]
  As in $(b)$, it suffices to show the homogeneous elements of $I(Y_1 \cup
  Y_2)$ are in $I(Y_1) \cap I(Y_2)$, and vice versa. But $f \in I(Y_1 \cup Y_2)$
  if and only if $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Y_1 \cup Y_2$, which holds if and
  only if $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Y_1$ and $P \in Y_2$. But this is equivalent
  to $f \in I(Y_1) \cap I(Y_2)$ by definition.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(d)$]
  $\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}} \subset I(Z(\mathfrak{a}))$, since any power of a
  homogeneous element $f \in \mathfrak{a}$
  vanishes at all points of $Z(\mathfrak{a})$ by definition.
  \par Conversely, suppose $f \in I(Z(\mathfrak{a}))$. Then, $f(P) = 0$ for all
  $P\in Z(\mathfrak{a})$, hence by the homogeneous Nullstellensatz (Exercise
  \ref{exc:2.1}), $f^q \in \mathfrak{a}$ for some $q>0$, i.e., $f \in
  \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(e)$]
  Because $Z(I(Y))$ is closed, by the definition of the closure, $Z(I(Y))
  \supset Y$ implies $Z(I(Y)) \supset \overline{Y}$. Now let $W$ be any closed
  set containing $Y$. Then $W = Z(\mathfrak{a})$ for some homogeneous ideal
  $\mathfrak{a}$. Then from (b), (d) and the fact that an ideal is contained in
  its radical ideal, $\mathfrak{a} \subset \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}=
  I(Z(\mathfrak{a})) \subset I(Y)$. Hence, $\mathfrak{a} \subset I(Y)$. So from
  $(a)$, we have $W = Z(\mathfrak{a}) \supset Z(I(Y))$. Hence, $Z(I(Y)) =
  \overline{Y}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}\mbox{}\label{exc:2.4}
  \begin{enuma}
    \item There is a one-to-one inclusion-reversing correspondence between
      algebraic sets in $\PP^n$ and homogeneous radical ideals of $S$ not equal
      to $S_+$ given by $Y \mapsto I(Y)$ and $\mathfrak{a} \mapsto
      Z(\mathfrak{a})$.
    \item An algebraic set $Y \subseteq \PP^n$ is irreducible if and only if $I(Y)$ is a prime ideal. 
    \item Show that $\PP^n$ itself is irreducible. 
   \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  The correspondence is one-to-one by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(d),(e)$, where we
  note that the correspondence is with homogeneous radical ideals of $S$ not
  equal to $S_+$ by Exercise \ref{exc:2.2}, and is inclusion-reversing by
  Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(a),(b)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  Suppose $Y$ is irreducible. Recall from p.~9 that to check primeness of
  $I(Y)$, it suffices to check that for any two homogeneous $f,g \in I(Y)$, $fg
  \in I(Y)$ implies either $f \in I(Y)$ or $g \in I(Y)$. So let $fg \in I(Y)$;
  then, $Y \subset Z(fg) = Z(f) \cup Z(g)$. Thus, $Y = (Y \cap Z(f)) \cup (Y \cap
  Z(g))$, which are both closed subsets of $Y$. Since $Y$ is irreducible, either
  $Y = Y \cap Z(f)$ or $Y = Y \cap Z(g)$, in which case $Y \subset Z(f)$ or
  $Y \subset Z(g)$, respectively. Thus either $f \in I(Y)$ or $g \in I(Y)$,
  respectively.
  \par Conversely, suppose $\mathfrak{p}$ is a homogeneous prime ideal, and
  suppose that $Z(\mathfrak{p}) = Y_1 \cup Y_2$. Then, $\mathfrak{p} = I(Y_1)
  \cap I(Y_2)$ by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(c)$, so either $\mathfrak{p} = I(Y_1)$
  or $\mathfrak{p} = I(Y_2)$. Thus, $Z(\mathfrak{p}) = Y_1$ or $Y_2$,
  respectively, hence it is irreducible.
  %Let $Y= Z(T)$ where $T \subset k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ is a set of homogeneous
  %polynomials. Let $CY \subset \AA^{n+1}$ be the affine variety defined by $T$.
  %Then, since the projection map $\AA^{n+1} \to
  %(\AA^{n+1}-\{(0,\cdots,0)\})/k^{\times} = \PP^{n}$ is surjective and
  %continuous, $Y$ is irreducible if and only if $CY$ is irreducible. From
  %Cor.~$1.4$, $CY$ is irreducible if and only if $I(CY)$ is prime. But $I(CY)$
  %is prime if and only if $I(Y)$ is prime. Hence, $Y$ is irreducible if and only
  %if $I(Y)$ is prime. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(c)$]
  $\PP^n = Z(0)$, and $(0) \subset k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ is a homogeneous prime
  ideal, hence $\PP^n$ is irreducible by $(b)$.
  %There are several ways to show $\PP^n$ is irreducible. One way you can do is to use that $U_0 \simeq \AA^n$ is irreducible, and $\PP^n = \overline{U_0}$ is irreducible as it is a closure of an irreducible subset (example 1.14). 
  %One another way is to see that $\PP^n = Z(\mathfrak{o})$, where $\mathfrak{o} = (0)$. As $(0)$ is a homogeneous prime ideal, $\PP^n$ is irreducible (from (b).  
\end{proof}

\begin{problem} \mbox{}
  \begin{enuma}
    \item $\PP^n$ is a noetherian topological space. 
    \item Every algebraic set in $\PP^n$ can be written uniquely as a finite
      union of irreducible algebraic sets, no one containing another. These are
      called its \emph{irreducible components}. 
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  Let $Y_1 \supset Y_2 \supset Y_3 \supset \cdots$ be a descending chain of
  closed subsets of $\PP^n$; then, $I(Y_1) \subset I(Y_2) \subset \cdots$ is an
  ascending chain of homogeneous radical ideals in $S = k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$
  (from Exercise $\ref{exc:2.4}(a)$). Then, this chain of ideals eventually
  stabilizes since $S$ is a noetherian ring. For each $i$, $Y_i = Z(I(Y_i))$, and
  so the descending chain of $Y_i$ also eventually stabilizes.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  From $(a)$, $\PP^n$ is noetherian, so by Prop.~$1.5$, every algebraic set in
  $\PP^n$ can be written uniquely as a finite union of irreducible closed
  subsets of $\PP^n$, which are algebraic by definition, such that no one
  contains another.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}\label{exc:2.6}
  If $Y$ is a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$, show that $\dim S(Y) = \dim Y + 1$. 
\end{problem}
%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:2.6}
%  Let $\varphi_i\colon U_i \to \AA^n$ be the homeomorphism of Prop.~$2.2$, and
%  let $Y_i = \varphi(Y \cap U_i)$. If $Y_i \ne \emptyset$, then $\dim Y_i = \dim
%  Y$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma $\ref{lem:2.6}$]
%  Note first $U_i$ is dense in $\PP^N$ hence $Y_i$ is dense in $Y$.
%  Now suppose $Z_0 \subset Z_1 \subset \cdots \subset Z_n$ is a sequence of
%  distinct closed irreducible subsets of $Y_i$. Then, $\overline{Z_0} \subset
%  \overline{Z_1} \subset \cdots \subset \overline{Z_n}$ is a sequence of
%  distinct closed irreducible subsets of $\overline{Y}$ by Ex.~$1.1.4$, hence
%  $\dim Y_i \le \dim Y$. In particular, $\dim Y_i < \infty$ since $\dim Y$ is
%  bounded by the dimension of the projective space $\PP^N$ containing $Y$.
%  
%  so choose a
%  maximal chain of irreducible closed subsets $Z_0 \subset \cdots \subset Z_n$,
%  with $n = \dim Y$. We can choose such a chain where $Z_0 \subset Y_i$ since 
%\end{proof}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\varphi_i\colon U_i \to \AA^n$ be the homeomorphism of Prop.~$2.2$, and
  let $Y_i = \varphi(Y \cap U_i)$.
  Let $A(Y_i)$ is the affine coordinate ring of $Y_i$.
  We want to show that $A(Y_i)$ can be identified with the subring
  $(S(Y)_{x_i})_0$ of elements of degree $0$ of the localized ring $S(Y)_{x_i}$.
  If $x_i \in I(Y)$, then $S(Y)_{x_i} = A(Y_i) = 0$, hence the identification is
  trivial. Otherwise, any element $\frac{f}{x_i^e} \in (S(Y)_{x_i})_0$ can be
  expressed as
  \[
    f\left(\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \cdots, \frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, 1, \frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i},
    \cdots, \frac{x_n}{x_i}\right),
  \]
  which is $\alpha(f) \in A(Y_i)$, where $\alpha$ is the function defined in Prop
  $2.2$. Conversely, for $f \in A(Y_i)$ of degree $e$, consider the function
  $\beta\colon A(Y_i) \to (S(Y)_{x_i})_0$ where $f \mapsto x_i^{-e}f$. Then
  $\alpha \circ \beta$ and $\beta \circ \alpha$ are identity maps. Thus,
  $A(Y_i)$ can be identified with $(S(Y)_{x_i})_0$, and so $S(Y)_{x_i} =
  ((S(Y)_{x_i})_0)[x_i, x_i^{-1}] \cong A(Y_i)[x_i, x_i^{-1}]$.
  \par From Thm.~$1.8$A, the transcendence degree of $K(A(Y_i)[x_i, x_i^{-1}]) =
  K(A(Y_i))(x_i)$ is one plus the transcendence degree of $K(A(Y_i))$. From
  Prop.~$1.7$, the transcendence degree of $K(A(Y_i)) = \dim Y_i$. Hence,  
  \[\dim S(Y) = \dim S(Y)_{x_i} = \dim Y_i + 1 \le \dim Y+1,\]
  where $\dim Y_i \le \dim Y$ by Exercise $1.10(a)$. Conversely, $\dim Y + 1 \le
  \dim S(Y)$ since an ascending sequence of irreducible closed subsets of $Y$
  corresponds by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.4}$ to an descending sequence of
  homogeneous prime ideals not equal to $S_+$, and such a sequence can be
  extended to one of length one higher by starting with $S_+$.
  \par Note we have shown that $\dim Y_i = \dim Y$ as long as $Y_i \ne
  \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}\mbox{}\label{exc:2.7}
  \begin{enuma}
    \item $\dim \PP^n = n$.
    \item If $Y \subseteq \PP^n$ is a quasi-projective variety, then $\dim Y =
      \dim \overline{Y}$.
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  From Exercise $\ref{exc:2.6}$,
  \begin{equation*}
    n + 1 = \dim k[x_0,\ldots,x_n] = \dim S(\PP^n) = \dim(\PP^n) +1,
  \end{equation*}
  hence $\dim \PP^n = n$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  Let $Y_i \coloneqq Y \cap U_i$ be nonempty. Then, by our remark at the end of
  the proof of Exercise $\ref{exc:2.6}$, $\dim Y_i = \dim Y$. Similarly, $\dim
  \overline{Y} = \dim Z_i$, where $Z_i$ is the closure of $Y_i$ in $U_i$. Thus,
  it suffices to show $\dim Z_i = \dim Y_i$, but this is exactly Prop.~$1.10$.
  %From Exercise $\ref{exc:2.6}$, $\dim S(Y) = \dim Y +1$. We note that $\dim S(Y) = \dim (CY)$, where $CY = \pi^{-1} (Y)$. $\pi : \AA^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to \PP^n$. This is true because $S(Y) = k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]/I(Y)$, and realizing this in an affine space $\AA^{n+1}$, we get $\dim S(Y) = \dim CY$(from prop 1.7). Then, from prop 1.10, $\dim S(Y) = \dim CY = \dim \overline{CY} = \dim C \overline{Y} = \dim S(\overline{Y})$. Hence, $\dim Y = \dim S(Y) -1 = \dim S(\overline{Y}) -1 = \dim \overline{Y}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}\label{exc:2.8}
  A projective variety $Y \subseteq \PP^n$ has dimension $n-1$ if
  and only if it is the zero set of a single irreducible homogeneous polynomial
  $f$ of positive degree. $Y$ is called a \emph{hypersurface} in $\PP^n$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $f$ be an irreducible homogeneous polynomial of positive degree. Then,
  $Y \coloneqq Z(f)$ has coordinate ring $k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]/(f)$, where $(f)$ is
  prime since $f$ is irreducible. By the Hauptidealsatz (Thm.~$1.11$A), $(f)$ has
  height $1$, so by Thm.~$1.8$A$(b)$, $\dim S(Y) = n$, and $\dim Y = n-1$ by
  Exercise $\ref{exc:2.6}$.
  \par Conversely, suppose $Y$ has dimension $n-1$. Then,
  \[ \dim S(Y) = \dim k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]/I(Y) = n\]
  by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.6}$, where $I(Y)$ is
  prime since $Y$ is irreducible by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.4}(b)$. Now $I(Y)$ is a
  height one prime in $k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ by Thm.~$1.8$A$(b)$, hence is
  generated by a single nonconstant irreducible polynomial of positive degree
  by Prop.~$1.12$A; it can moreover be taken to be homogeneous since $I(Y)$ is a
  homogeneous ideal, hence is generated by homogeneous elements.
  %Let $Y$ be a projective variety of dimension $n-1$. Then, $\dim S(Y) = n$ from
  %Exercise $\ref{exc:2.6}$. Regarded as a polynomial in $k[x_0,\cdots,x_n]$
  %(i.e. considering $Z( S(Y))$ an affine space $\AA^{n+1}$), $CY = Z(S(Y))$ is
  %a $n$-dimensional variety. Using prop 1.13, an affine cone $CY$ of $Y$ is the
  %zero set $Z(f)$ of a single nonconstant irreducible polynomial. Thus, $Y =
  %Z(f')$ where $f'$ the homogenization of $f$. % This just isn't true...
  %\par Conversely, let $Y= Z(F)$ where $f \in  S = k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ be an irreducible homogeneous polynomial of positive degree (thus $f \neq 0$). By Hauptidealsatz (theorem 1.11A), $(f)$ has height 1, as $(f)$ is a minimal prime ideal containing $f$. Hence, in an affine cone, $CY = Z(f)$ has dimension $n+1-1 =n$ (by theorem 1.8A). Hence, $\dim Y = \dim CY-1 = n-1$. 
  %\par cf. It is quite obvious (to Takumi who is quite unhappy to see the phrase "quite obvious": I know you are unhappy, but I-perhaps you- will show this soon! :p) that $\dim Y = \dim CY -1$, and we will show that in exercise 2.10 (c).
  %I dunno Kyu, this problem is super simple without talking about affine cones

\begin{problem}[Projective Closure of an Affine Variety]\label{exc:2.9}
  If $Y \subseteq \AA^n$ is an affine variety, we identify $\AA^n$ with an open
  set $U_0 \subset \PP^n$ by the homeomorphism $\varphi_0$. Then we can speak of
  $\overline{Y}$, the closure of $Y$ in $\PP^n$, which is called the
  \emph{projective closure} of $Y$. 
 \begin{enuma}
   \item Show that $I(\overline{Y})$ is the ideal generated by $\beta(I(Y))$,
     using the notation of the proof of $(2.2)$. 
   \item Let $Y \subset \AA^n$ be the twisted cubic of \emph{(Ex $1.2$)}. Its
     projective closure $\overline{Y} \subset \PP^n$ is called the \emph{twisted
     cubic curve} in $\PP^3$. Find generators for $I(Y)$ and $I(\overline{Y})$,
     and use this example to show that if $f_1, \ldots, f_r$ generate $I(Y)$,
     then $\beta(f_1), \ldots, \beta(f_r)$ do \emph{not} necessarily generate
     $I(\overline{Y})$. 
 \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  Let $J$ be the ideal generated by $\beta(I(Y))$. Since $\varphi_0^{-1}(Y) =
  Z(\beta(I(Y)) \cap U_0 \subset Z(\beta(I(Y)))$, we have
  $\overline{Y} \subset Z(\beta(I(Y)))$ by the
  definition of closure. Thus, $I(\overline{Y}) \supset I(Z(\beta(I(Y))))$
  by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(b)$. Finally, $I(Z(\beta(I(Y)))) = I(Z(J)) = \sqrt{J}
  \supset J$ by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(d)$, hence $I(\overline{Y}) \supset J$.
  \par Conversely, we have $\varphi_0^{-1}(Y) \subset \overline{Y}$, hence
  $I(\varphi_0^{-1}(Y)) \supset I(\overline{Y})$ by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(b)$. But
  $J \supset I(\varphi_0^{-1}(Y))$ since any element $F \in
  I(\varphi_0^{-1}(Y))$ has $\alpha(F) \in I(Y)$, hence $F = \beta(\alpha(F))
  \in \beta(I(Y))$. Thus, $J \supset I(\overline{Y})$ and we conclude that $J =
  I(\overline{Y})$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  From Exercise $1.2$, $I(Y) = (y-x^2, z-x^3)$.
  We claim $I(\overline{Y}) = (wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy) \subset k[w,x,y,z]$.
  $\supset$ is clear since
  \begin{alignat*}{4}
    wy &{}- x^2 &{}={}& \beta(y-x^2)\\
    xz &{}- y^2 &{}={}& \beta(xz-y^2) &{}={}& \beta(x(z-x^3)-(y+x^2)(y-x^2))\\
    wz &{}- xy  &{}={}& \beta(z-xy)   &{}={}& \beta((z-x^3) - x(y-x^2))
  \end{alignat*}
  and then since $I(\overline{Y}) \supset \beta(I(Y))$ by $(a)$.
  \par Conversely, we want to show $I(\overline{Y}) \subset
  (wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$. First, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy) \cap U_0 \subset \varphi_0^{-1}(Y),
  \end{equation*}
  for if $[w:x:y:z] \in Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy) \cap U_0$, then we can let $w=1$,
  so $[1:x:y:z] \in Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ satisfies $y-x^2$, $xz - y^2$, and
  $z - xy$, hence also satisfies $z - x^3$ by combining the first and third
  relations, and therefore $[1:x:y:z] \in 
  \varphi_0^{-1}(Y)$. Taking closures, we then have $Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)
  \subset \overline{Y}$.
  \par To show $I(\overline{Y}) \subset
  (wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$, then, by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(d)$ it suffices to
  show $(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ is radical. We will moreover show
  $(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ is prime; by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.4}(b)$, it suffices
  to show $Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ is irreducible. We note that the image of an
  irreducible variety through a regular map $f\colon X \to X'$ is irreducible, for
  otherwise we would get a decomposition of $X$ by taking the preimage of the
  decomposition of $f(X')$. So, we claim $Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ is the image
  of the regular map
  \begin{align*}
    f\colon \mathbb{P}^1 &\to \PP^3\\
    [s:t] &\mapsto [s^3:s^2t:st^2:t^3]
  \end{align*}
  We note that the image is contained in $Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ since the
  coordinates satisfy the relations
  \begin{gather*}
    wy=(s^3)(st^2) = s^4t^2 = (s^2t)^2 = x^2,\\
    xz=(s^2t)(t^3) = s^2t^4 = (st^2)^2 = y^2,\\
    wz=(s^3)(t^3)=s^3t^3=(s^2t)(st^2)=xy.
  \end{gather*}
  It remains to show any point $[w:x:y:z] \in Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ has
  preimage in $\mathbb{P}^1$. In $Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$, either $w \ne 0$ or $z \ne 0$, for otherwise $x=y=0$ as well using $wy=x^2$ and $xz=y^2$. If $w \ne 0$, then consider the point $(w^{1/3},xw^{-2/3}) \in k^2$, for arbitrary choice of cube root (which exists since $k$ is algebraically closed). Then,
  \begin{equation*}
    f\left[w^{1/3}:\frac{x}{w^{2/3}}\right] = \left[ w:w^{2/3} \cdot
    \frac{x}{w^{2/3}}:w^{1/3} \cdot \frac{x^2}{w^{4/3}}:
    \frac{x^3}{w^{2}}\right] = \left[ w:x:\frac{x^2}{w}:
    \frac{x^3}{w^{2}}\right],
  \end{equation*}
  using $wy=x^2$, $x^2w^{-1} = y$. Using the same equation, $x^3w^{-2} = wxyw^{-2} = xyw^{-1}$, and using $wz=xy$, $xyw^{-1} = z$. Thus, $[w^{1/3}:xw^{-2/3}] \mapsto [w:x:y:z]$. Now if $z \ne 0$, then consider the point $(yz^{-2/3},z^{1/3}) \in k^2$, for arbitrary choice of cube root. Then,
  \begin{equation*}
    f\left[ \frac{y}{z^{2/3}}:z^{1/3} \right] = \left[ \frac{y^3}{z^2}:\frac{y^2}{z^{4/3}} \cdot z^{1/3}:\frac{y}{z^{2/3}} \cdot z^{2/3}:z \right] = \left[ \frac{y^3}{z^2}:\frac{y^2}{z}:y:z \right],
  \end{equation*}
  using $xz = y^2$, $y^2z^{-1} = x$. Using the same equation, $y^3z^{-2} =
  xyzz^{-2} = xyz^{-1}$, and using $wz = xy$, $xyz^{-1} = w$. Thus,
  $[yz^{-2/3}:z^{1/3}] \mapsto [w:x:y:z]$. This shows $f(\PP^1) =
  Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$, hence $Z(wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$ is irreducible, and by
  the above $I(\overline{Y}) = (wy-x^2,xz-y^2,wz-xy)$.
  \par Finally, we note that letting $f_1 = y-x^2,f_2 = z-x^3$, we have
  \[I(\overline{Y}) \setminus (\beta(f_1),\beta(f_2)) =
    I(\overline{Y}) \setminus (wy-x^2,w^2z-x^3) \ni wz-xy,\]
  since every homogeneous degree two polynomial in $I(\overline{Y})$ is a
  $k$-multiple of $wy-x^2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[The Cone Over a Projective Variety]\label{exc:2.10}
  Let $Y \subset \PP^n$ be a nonempty algebraic set, and let $\theta\colon
  \AA^{n+1} \setminus \{(0,\cdots,0\} \to \PP^n$ be the map which sends the
  point with affine coordinates $(a_0, \cdots, a_n)$ to the point with
  homogeneous coordinates $[a_0 :\cdots: a_n]$. We define the \emph{affine cone}
  over $Y$ to be $$C(Y) = \theta^{-1}(Y) \cup \{(0,\cdots, 0)\}.$$ 
  \begin{enuma}
    \item Show that $C(Y)$ is an algebraic set in $\AA^{n+1}$, whose ideal is equal to $I(Y)$, considered as an ordinary ideal in $k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$. 
    \item $C(Y)$ is irreducible if and only if $Y$ is irreducible. 
    \item $\dim C(Y) = \dim Y +1$.
  \end{enuma}
  Sometimes we consider the projective closure $\overline{C(Y)}$ of $C(Y)$ in
  $\PP^{n+1}$. This is called the \emph{projective cone} over $Y$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  $I(C(Y)) = I(\theta^{-1}(Y) \cup {(0, \cdots, 0)}) = I(Y)$ because if $f \in
  I(Y)$, $f(cy) =0$ for any constant $c \in k$. Hence, $f \in I(C(Y))$, because
  $C(Y)$ consists of all scalar multiples of elements of Y. Hence, $I(Y)
  \subseteq I(C(Y))$. Obviously, $I(Y) \supseteq I(C(Y))$ as we can embed $Y$
  into $C(Y)$, and then by applying Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(b)$. Hence,
  $C(Y) = Z(I(Y))$ is algebraic, and its ideal is equal to $I(Y)$, considered as
  an ordinary ideal in $k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  $C(Y)$ is irreducible if and only if $I(C(Y))$ is prime by Cor.~1.4. But by
  $(a)$, $I(C(Y)) = I(Y)$, hence $I(C(Y))$ is prime if and only if $Y$ is
  irreducible by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.4}(b)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(c)$]
  $\dim C(Y) = \dim A(Y)$ by Prop.~1.7. But $A(Y) = S(Y)$ by $(b)$, hence $\dim
  C(Y) = \dim A(Y) = \dim S(Y) = \dim Y + 1$ by Exercise \ref{exc:2.6}.
  %We can also show that $\dim
  %C(Y) = \dim Y +1$ by directly using the definition of the dimension (pg 5). If
  %$\dim Y = n$, there is a chain $Z_0 \subsetneq Z_1 \subsetneq \cdots\subsetneq
  %Z_n \subseteq Y$ of irreducible variates. An origin is added in $C(Y)$, and we
  %can add the point (which is irreducible) to the beginning of the given chain.
  %Hence, $\dim C(Y) = n+1$. 
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}[Linear Varieties in $\PP^n$]\label{exc:2.11}
  A hypersurface defined by a linear polynomial is called a \emph{hyperplane}. 
  \begin{enuma}
    \item Show that the following two conditions are equivalent for a variety $Y \subset \PP^n$: 
      \begin{enumi}
        \item $I(Y)$ can be generated by linear polynomials
        \item $Y$ can be written as an intersection of hyperplanes. 
      \end{enumi}
      In this case we say that $Y$ is a \emph{linear variety} in $\PP^n$.
    \item If $Y$ is a linear variety of dimension $r$ in $\PP^n$, show that $I(Y)$ is minimally generated by $n-r$ linear polynomials 
    \item Let $Y,Z$ be linear varieties in $\PP^n$, with $\dim Y = r$, $\dim Z = s$. If $r+s-n \geq 0$, then $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$. Furthermore, if $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$, then $Y \cap Z$ is a linear variety of dimension $\geq r+s-n$ (Think of $\AA^{n+1}$ as a vector space over $k$, and work with its subspaces.)
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  $(i) \Rightarrow (ii)$. Assume that $I(Y) = (f_1, \ldots, f_m)$ where $f_i$
  are linear polynomials. Then, $Y = Z(I(Y)) = Z(f_1, \ldots, f_m) = Z(f_1) \cap
  \cdots \cap Z(f_m)$. Thus, $Y$ can be written as an intersection of hyperplanes. 
  \par $(ii) \Rightarrow (i)$. Let $Y = Z(f_1) \cap \cdots \cap Z(f_m)$, where
  $f_i$'s are linear polynomials. Then, $Y = Z(f_1) \cap \cdots \cap Z(f_m) =
  Z(f_1, \ldots, f_m)$, so $I(Y) = \sqrt{(f_1, \ldots, f_m)} = (f_1, \ldots, f_m)$
  by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(d)$ because the $f_i$'s are linear. For, by
  Gaussian elimination we can assume $f_i = x_{j_i} - \ell_i$ for some linear
  polynomials $\ell_i$ not containing any $x_{j_i}$, hence
  $k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_m)$ is isomorphic to $k[y_0,\ldots,y_{n-m}]$,
  which is reduced, hence $(f_1,\ldots,f_m)$ is radical.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  Let $f_1,\ldots,f_m$ be a set of minimal generators for $I(Y)$. Then, the $f_i$ are
  linearly independent, so by the same Gaussian elimination argument as in
  $(a)$, we have $S(Y) = k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_m) \cong
  k[y_0,\ldots,y_{n-m}]$. By Exercise \ref{exc:2.6}, $n - m + 1 = \dim S(Y) =
  \dim Y + 1 = r + 1$, hence $n-m = r$, and $m = n-r$.
  %Assume that $Y$ is a linear variety of dimension $r$, but $I(Y)$ is minimally
  %generated by $m > n-r$ linear polynomials. Then, we see that $I(Y) = (f_1,
  %\cdots, f_m)$ where each $f_i$'s are linear, and the $f_i$ are linearly
  %independent. Then, $\dim S(Y) = \dim (S/I(Y)) = n+1-m < n-n+r+1 = r+1$ by the
  %same Gaussian elimination argument as in $(a)$. Hence, from Exercise
  %\ref{exc:2.6}, we conclude that $\dim Y = \dim S(Y) -1 < r+1-1 = r$, so $\dim
  %Y < r$, a contradiction. Hence, if $Y$ is a linear variety of dimension $r$ in
  %$\PP^n$, $I(Y)$ is minimally generated by at most $n-r$ linear polynomials. On
  %the other hand, if it is generated by $m < n-r$ elements, then $\dim S(Y) =
  %\dim (S/I(Y)) > n-n+r+1 = r+1$, so $\dim Y = \dim S(Y) -1 > r$, a
  %contradiction. Hence, $I(Y)$ is minimally generated by $n-r$ linear polynomials.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(c)$]
  Let $Y,Z$ be linear varieties in $\PP^n$ with $\dim Y = r$ and $\dim Z = s$,
  where $r+s-n \ge 0$. By $(b)$, $I(Y)$ and $I(Z)$ are respectively generated by
  $f_1,\ldots,f_{n-r}$, and $g_1,\ldots,g_{n-s}$, for $f_i,g_j$ linear polynomials.
  Consider their affine cones $C(Y)$ and $C(Z)$ in
  $\AA^{n+1}$; $I(C(Y)),I(C(Z))$ are generated by the $f_i,g_j$ by
  Exercise $\ref{exc:2.10}(a)$. Then,
  \begin{equation*}
    \dim C(Y \cap Z) = \operatorname{corank} \begin{pmatrix}
      \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt} & f_1     & \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt}\\
      \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt} & \vdots  & \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt}\\
      \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt} & f_{n-r} & \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt}\\
      \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt} & g_1     & \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt}\\
      \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt} & \vdots  & \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt}\\
      \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt} & g_{n-s} & \rule[.5ex]{1em}{0.4pt}
    \end{pmatrix} \ge (n+1) - (2n - r - s) = 1 + (r + s - n)
  \end{equation*}
  by linear algebra, since $C(Y) \cap C(Z) = C(Y \cap Z)$ by looking at
  generators and using Exercise $\ref{exc:2.10}(a)$. By Exercise $\ref{exc:2.10}(c)$,
  we therefore have $\dim (Y \cap Z) \ge r + s - n \ge 0$ when $r + s - n \ge 0$,
  hence $Y \cap Z \ne \emptyset$; moreover, in this case, $Y \cap Z$ is a linear
  variety of dimension $\ge r + s - n$.
  %Let $Y,Z$ be linear varieties in $\PP^n$, with $\dim Y = r$, $\dim Z = s$
  %where $r+s-n \geq 0$. Since $\dim Y = r$, $\dim Z = s$, respectively, from $(b)$
  %we know that $I(Y)$ (resp.\ $I(Z)$) is minimally generated by $n-r$ (resp.\ $n-s$)
  %linear polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_{n-r}$ (resp.\ $g_1, \ldots g_{n-s}$). Then,
  %$I(Y)+I(Z) = (f_1, \ldots, f_{n-r}, g_1, \ldots, g_{n-s}) = J$.
  %Since $r+s-n \ge 0$, $J$ is minimally generated by at most $2n-s-r \le n$ linear
  %polynomials. Since $Y \supset Z(J)$ and $Z \supset Z(J)$, we have $Y \cap Z
  %\supset Z(J)$, so it suffices to show $Z(J) \ne \emptyset$. By the
  %weak Nullstellensatz \cite[Exc.~5.17]{AM69}, $Z(J) \ne \emptyset$ if $\sqrt{J}
  %= J \ne (1)$. But this is true because $J$ is minimally generated by at most
  %$2n-s-r \leq n$ linear polynomials, and in order for $J = (1)$, we need at
  %least $n+1$ linearly independent linear polynomials. Hence, $Y \cap Z \neq
  %\emptyset$.
  %\par Now, assume that $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$. Then, from (a), $Y = \cap_i Z(f_i)$ and $Z = \cap_j Z(g_j)$ for for $f_i, g_j$ : linear polynomials. From (b), we can choose $f_i$, $g_j$ such that $i = 1, \cdots, n-r$, and $j = 1, \cdots n-s$. Then, $Y \cap Z = (\cap_i Z(f_i)) \cap (\cap_j Z(g_j))$, which is again an intersection of hyperplanes. Thus, $I(Y\cap Z)$ can be generated by $(r+s)$ linear polynomials $f_i, g_j$. That is, $Y \cap Z$ is a linear variety such that $I(Y\cap Z)$ is minimally generated by at most $2n-r-s$ linear polynomials, thus by $(b)$, $\dim Y\cap Z \geq  n- (2n-r-s) = r+s-n$. 
  %Note) This is a special case of the projective dimension ( page 48 theorem 1.7.2)
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[The \emph{$d$-Uple} Embedding]\label{exc:2.12}
  For given $n, d>0$, let
  $M_0,\ldots, M_N$ be all the monomials of degree $d$ in the $n+1$ variables
  $x_0, \ldots x_n$, where $N = \binom{n+d}{n} -1.$ We define a mapping
  $\rho_d\colon \PP^n \to \PP^N$ by sending the point $P = (a_0, \ldots, a_n)$
  to the point $\rho_d(P) = (M_0(a), \ldots, M_N(a))$ obtained by substituting
  the $a_i$ in the monomials $M_j$. This is called the $d$-uple \emph{embedding}
  of $\PP^n$ in $\PP^N$. For example, if $n=1, d=2$, then $N= 2$, and the image
  $Y$ of the $2$-uple embedding of $\PP^1$ in $\PP^2$ is a conic. 
  \begin{enuma}
    \item Let $\theta\colon k[y_0, \ldots, y_N] \to k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$ be the
      homorphism defined by sending $y_i$ to $M_i$, and let $\mathfrak{a}$ be
      the kernel of $\theta$. Then $\mathfrak{a}$ is homogeneous prime ideal, and
      so $Z(\mathfrak{a})$ is a projective variety in $\PP^N$. 
    \item Show that the image of $\rho_d$ is exactly $Z(\mathfrak{a})$.
    \item Now show that $\rho_d$ is a homeomorphism of $\PP^n$ onto the projective
      variety $Z(\mathfrak{a})$. 
    \item Show that the twisted cubic curve in $\PP^3$
      \hyperref[exc:2.9]{\emph{(Ex.\ $2.9$)}} is equal to the $3$-uple
      embedding of $\PP^1$ in $\PP^3$, for suitable choice of coordinates. 
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  Note that $\theta\colon y_i \mapsto M_i$, and the degrees of $M_i$'s are all
  $d$. As all $y_i$'s are mapped to polynomials of the same degree, $\theta$ is
  a graded ring homomorphism by letting $\deg y_i = d$, and so
  $\mathfrak{a}= \ker \theta$ is a homogeneous ideal by \cite[Ch.\ II, \S11.3,
  Prop.\ 3]{Bou74}. To show that $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime, we know $k[y_0,
  \ldots, y_N]/\mathfrak{a}$ is isomorphic to a subring of $k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$,
  hence $k[y_0, \ldots, y_N]/\mathfrak{a}$ is a domain and $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  We will show that if $Z(T) \subset \PP^n$ is a closed set in $\PP^n$, then
  $\rho_d(Z(T)) = Z(\theta^{-1}(T))$. First let $P \in Z(T)$, and
  suppose $f \in \theta^{-1}(T)$. Then,
  \begin{equation*}
    f(\rho_d(P)) = f(M_0(a),\ldots,M_n(a)) = (\theta f)(P) = 0
  \end{equation*}
  since $\theta f \in T$. Thus, $\rho_d(Z(T)) \subset Z(\theta^{-1}(T))$.
  \par Conversely, suppose $[b_0:\cdots:b_N] \in Z(\theta^{-1}(T))$.
  %Let $\rho_d(P) \in \Im \rho_d$, and suppose $f \in \mathfrak{a} = \ker\theta$.
  %Then, $f(\rho_d(P)) = f(M_0(a), \ldots, M_N(a)) = (\theta f)(a) = 0$, and so
  %$\rho_d(P) \in Z(\mathfrak{a})$. Thus, $\Im \rho_d \subset Z(\mathfrak{a})$. 
  %\par Conversely, we claim $Z(\mathfrak{a}) \subset \Im \rho_d$. First suppose
  %that we can show $\Im \rho_d$ is closed. Then, it suffices to show
  %$\mathfrak{a} \supset I(\Im \rho_d)$. But any $f \in I(\Im \rho_d)$ has $f(Q)
  %= 0$ for all $Q = [a_0 : \cdots : a_N] \in \Im \rho_d$, and so
  %$f(M_0(a),\ldots,M_n(a)) = (\theta f)(a) = 0$, i.e., $f \in \ker\theta =
  %\mathfrak{a}$.
  %\par It remains to show $\Im\rho_d$ is in fact closed. We will actually show
  %that $\rho_d$ is a closed map $\PP^n \to \PP^N$. So suppose $Y \subset \PP^n$
  %is closed. We claim $\rho_d(Y) = Z(\theta^{-1}(I(Y)))$.
  Suppose $b_0 \ne 0$ and that $M_0 = x_0^d$ and suppose $M_i = x_i^{d-1}x_0$
  for $1 \le i \le n$; note that any other case follows analogously to
  this one after permutation of coordinates in $\PP^n$ and $\PP^N$.
  Note since $b_0 \ne 0$ that we can moreover assume $b_0 = 1$ since we are
  working with projective coordinates.
  Then, any other $M_\ell = x_0^{e^\ell_0}x_1^{e^\ell_1}\cdots
  x_n^{e^\ell_n}$ satisfies
  \begin{align*}
    M_\ell &= x_0^{e^\ell_0} \left(\frac{M_1}{x_0^{d-1}}\right)^{e^\ell_1}
    \left(\frac{M_{i_2}}{x_0^{d-1}}\right)^{e^\ell_2} \cdots
    \left(\frac{M_n}{x_0^{d-1}}\right)^{e^\ell_n}\\
    &= \frac{x_0^{e^\ell_0}}{x_0^{(d-e^\ell_0)(d-1)}}M_1^{e^\ell_1}M_2^{e^\ell_2}
    \cdots M_n^{e^\ell_n}\\
    &= \frac{M_0}{M_0^{d-e^\ell_0}} M_1^{e^\ell_1}M_2^{e^\ell_2}\cdots M_n^{e^\ell_n}
  \end{align*}
  hence
  \begin{equation*}
    M_0^{d-e^\ell_0}M_\ell - M_0M_1^{e^\ell_1}M_2^{e^\ell_2}\cdots
    M_n^{e^\ell_n} = 0,
  \end{equation*}
  and so
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:2.12b}
    y_0^{d-e^\ell_0}y_\ell - y_0y_1^{e^\ell_1}y_2^{e^\ell_2}\cdots
    y_n^{e^\ell_n} \in \ker\theta = \mathfrak{a} \subset \theta^{-1}(T).
  \end{equation}
  We therefore claim that $P = [1 : b_1 : \cdots : b_n] \mapsto [b_0:\cdots:b_N]$.
  For, the $\ell$th coordinate of $\rho_d(P)$ is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \rho_d(P)_\ell = M_\ell(b) = M_1^{e^\ell_1}(b)M_2^{e^\ell_2}(b) \cdots
    M_n^{e^\ell_n}(b) = b_1^{e^\ell_1}b_2^{e^\ell_2} \cdots b_n^{e^\ell_n} =
    b_\ell,
  \end{equation*}
  using \eqref{eq:2.12b} and the fact that we assumed $b_0 = 1$. Thus, $[b_0 :
  \cdots : b_N] \in \Im\rho_d$; it remains to show $[b_0 : \cdots : b_N] \in
  \rho_d(Z(T))$, i.e., that $P = [1 : b_1 : \cdots : b_n] \in Z(T)$. So let
  $g \in T$; then, we know that if $\tilde{g} \in \theta^{-1}(g) \subset
  \theta^{-1}(T)$, then
  \begin{equation*}
    g(P) = (\theta\tilde{g})(P) = \tilde{g}(M_0(b),\ldots,M_N(b)) =
    \tilde{g}(\rho_d(P)) = 0,
  \end{equation*}
  since $\tilde{g} \in \theta^{-1}(T)$. Thus, $P = [1 : b_1 : \cdots : b_n] \in
  Z(\theta^{-1}(T))$, and so $Z(\theta^{-1}(T)) \subset \rho_d(Z(T))$ as
  claimed. Combined with the above, this shows $\rho_d(Z(T)) =
  Z(\theta^{-1}(T))$. In particular, letting $T = \{0\}$, then $\theta^{-1}(0) =
  \ker\theta = \mathfrak{a}$, and so $\Im \rho_d = Z(\mathfrak{a})$.
  %$y_0^{d-e^\ell_0} - y_0y_1^{e^\ell_1}y_2^{e^\ell_2}\cdots y_n^{e^\ell_n} \in
  %\mathfrak{a}$. In particular, this shows that 
  %Let $l$ be a coordinate in $\PP^N$ such that $b_l \ne 0$ and $M_l = x_l^d$;
  %Let $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_n$ be the coordinates in $\PP^N$ such that $M_{i_j} =
  %x_j^d$ for each $j$. Then, we claim that
  %\begin{equation*}
  %  \rho_d([b_{i_0}^{1/d} : b_{i_1}^{1/d} : \cdots : b_{i_n}^{1/d}]) =
  %  [b_0:b_1:\cdots:b_N].
  %\end{equation*}
  %For, suppose $M_\ell = x_0^{e^\ell_0}x_1^{e^\ell_1}\cdots x_n^{e^\ell_n}$ is
  %the monomial corresponding to the $\ell$th coordinate in $\PP^N$. Then,
  %\begin{equation*}
  %  M_\ell(a) = a_0^{e^\ell_0}a_1^{e^\ell_1} \cdots a_n^{e^{\ell_n}} = 
  %\end{equation*}
  %Suppose
  %$[a_0:\cdots:a_N] \in Z(\mathfrak{a})$. After permutation of coordinates, we
  %can assume $a_0 \ne 0$, so $a_0 = 1$, and that the $M_i$ are ordered such that
  %the first $n+1$ monomials are
  %$x_0^d,x_0^{d-1}x_1,x_0^{d-1}x_2,\ldots,x_0^{d-1}x_n$. Note that any other
  %$M_i = x_0^{d^i_0}x_1^{d^i_1}\cdots x_n^{d^i_n}$ satisfies
  %\begin{align*}
  %  M_i &= x_0^{d^i_0} \left(\frac{M_1}{x_0^{d-1}}\right)^{d^i_1}
  %  \left(\frac{M_2}{x_0^{d-1}}\right)^{d^i_2} \cdots
  %  \left(\frac{M_n}{x_0^{d-1}}\right)^{d^i_n}\\
  %  &= \frac{x_0^{d^i_0}}{x_0^{(d-d^i_0)(d-1)}}M_1^{d^i_1}M_2^{d^i_2}\cdots
  %  M_n^{d^i_n}\\
  %  &= \frac{M_0}{M_0^{d-d^i_0}} M_1^{d^i_1}M_2^{d^i_2}\cdots M_n^{d^i_n}
  %\end{align*}
  %hence $M_0^{d-d^i_0}M_i - M_0M_1^{d^i_1}M_2^{d^i_2}\cdots M_n^{d^i_n}$, and so
  %$y_0^{d-d^i_0} - y_0y_1^{d^i_1}y_2^{d^i_2}\cdots y_n^{d^i_n} \in \mathfrak{a}$.
  %Thus, we see that
  %\begin{equation*}
  %  \rho_d([1 : a_1 : a_2 : \cdots : a_n]) = [1 : \cdots : a_N],
  %\end{equation*}
  %since $a_i = a_1^{d^i_1}a_2^{d^i_2}\cdots a_n^{d^i_n}$,
  %and so $Z(\mathfrak{a}) \subset \Im \rho_d$.
  %by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}$, it suffices to show $\mathfrak{a} \supset I(\Im \rho_d)$. Pick $f \in I(\Im \rho_d)$. Then, $f(Q) = 0$ for all $Q \in \Im \rho_d$. Then, $f(M_0, \cdots, M_N)= 0 \Rightarrow f \in \Ker \theta$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(c)$]
  From $(b)$ we know that $Z(\mathfrak{a}) = \Im \rho_d$.
  $\rho_d$ is injective since for $[b_0:\cdots:b_N] \in \Im\rho_d$,
  assuming $b_0 = 1$ and that $M_i = x_i^{d-1}x_0$ for $1 \le i \le n$, we saw in
  $(b)$ that the preimage $P = [b_0:\cdots:b_n]$ was uniquely determined by
  $[b_0:\cdots:b_N]$; any other case is analogous after change of coordinates.
  $\rho_d$ is closed as shown in $(b)$, and $\rho_d$ is continuous by Lem.~$3.6$
  since $\rho_d$ is a regular map. Thus, $\rho_d$ is a homeomorphism onto its
  image $Z(\mathfrak{a})$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(d)$]
  From Exercise \ref{exc:2.9}, we know that the map $\PP^1 \to \PP^3$ defined as
  $[s:t] \mapsto [s^3: s^2t: st^2: t^3]$ sends $\PP^1$ to the twisted cubic.
  Choosing $M_0 = s^3, M_1 = s^2t, M_2 = st^2, M_3 = t^3$, we see that the twisted
  cubic curve in $\PP^3$ is equal to the $3$-uple embedding of $\PP^1$ in $\PP^3$. 
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}
  Let $Y$ be the image of the $2$-uple embedding of $\PP^2$ in $\PP^5$. This is the
  \emph{Veronese surface}. If $Z \subseteq Y$ is a closed curve (a \emph{curve} is 
  a variety of dimension $1$), show that there exists a hypersurface $V \subseteq
  \PP^5$ such that $V \cap Y = Z$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\nu\colon \PP^2 \to \PP^5$ be the $2$-uple embedding of $\PP^2$ in
  $\PP^5$. Suppose $Z \subset Y$ is a closed curve; then, its inverse image
  $\nu^{-1}(Z)$ is a closed curve in $\PP^2$, hence by Exercise \ref{exc:2.8} is
  given as the zero set of a single irreducible homogeneous polynomial $f$ of
  positive degree, and so $\nu^{-1}(Z) = Z(f) = Z(f^2)$, where we note $f(P) =
  0$ if and only if $f^2(P) = 0$. Then, by our proof of Exercise $\ref{exc:2.12}(b)$,
  \begin{equation*}
    Z = \nu(\nu^{-1}(Z)) = \nu(Z(f^2)) = Z(\theta^{-1}(f^2)).
  \end{equation*}
  Since $f^2 \in k[x^2,y^2,z^2,xy,yz,zx]$, there exists $g \in
  k[x_0,\ldots,x_5]$,
  a homogeneous polynomial, such that $\theta(g) = f^2$.
  It therefore suffices to show $Z(\theta^{-1}(f^2)) = Z(g) \cap V$, for $Z(g)$
  is a hypersurface of $\PP^5$. But this is clear, for
  \begin{equation*}
    Z(\theta^{-1}(f^2)) = Z((g)+\mathfrak{a}) = Z(g) \cap Z(\mathfrak{a}) =
    Z(g) \cap V
  \end{equation*}
  since $Z(\mathfrak{a}) = V$ by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.12}(b)$.
  %The Veronese map $\nu\colon \PP^2 \to \PP^5$ is defined to be $\nu\colon [x:y:z] \mapsto [x^2: y^2:z^2:xy:yz:zx]$. From exercise 2.8, a projective variety $Z$ is a curve (i.e. of dimension 1) if and only if it is the zero set of a single irreducible homogeneous polynomial $f$ of positive degree. Let $Z = Z(f)$ where $f \in k[x,y,z]$ is a homogeneous polynomial of positive degree. Then, $f^2 \in k[x^2:y^2:z^2:xy:yz:zx]$. Thus, there exists a homogeneous polynomial $g \in k[x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_5]$ such that $g|_Y = f$. $V = Z(g)$ is a hypersurface of $\PP^5$, and $V \cap Y = Z$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[The Segre Embedding]\label{exc:2.14}
  Let $\psi\colon \PP^r \times \PP^s \to \PP^N$ be the map defined by sending
  the ordered pair $(a_0, \ldots, a_r) \times (b_0, \ldots, b_s)$ to $(\ldots,
  a_ib_j, \ldots)$ in lexicographic order, where $N = rs + r +s$. Note that
  $\psi$ is well-defined and injective. It is called the \emph{Segre embedding}.
  Show that the image of $\psi$ is a subvariety of $\PP^N$.
  %[Hint: Let the homogeneous coordinates of $\PP^N$ be $\{z_{ij}:i=0, \cdots, r, j = 0,\cdots, s\}$, and let $\mathfrak{a}$ be the kernel of the homomorphism $k[{z_{ij}}] \to k [x_1, \cdots, x_r, y_0, \cdots, y_s]$ which sends $z_{ij}$ to $x_iy_j$. Then show that $\Im \psi = Z(\mathfrak{a})$.]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  $\psi$ is well-defined since a $k$-multiple of $[a_0:\cdots:a_r]$ maps to the
  same $k$-multiple of $[\cdots:a_ib_j:\cdots]$, and similarly for
  $[b_0:\cdots:b_s]$. Now suppose that $\psi(a,b) = \psi(c,d)$. Then,
  $[\cdots:a_ib_j:\cdots] = [\cdots:c_id_j:\cdots]$ so $a_ib_j = \lambda c_id_j$
  for each $i,j$ for some $\lambda \in k$. There exists $j_0$ such that
  $b_{j_0} \ne 0$, which implies $d_{j_0} \ne 0$ for we must have
  $a_ib_{j_0} = \lambda c_id_{j_0}$. Then, we see $a_i = (\lambda
  d_{j_0}/b_{j_0}) c_i$, hence $[a_0:\cdots:a_r] = [c_0:\cdots:c_r]$. Similarly,
  $[b_0:\cdots:b_s] = [d_0:\cdots:d_s]$, hence $\psi$ is injective.
  \par Now let $\theta$ be the homomorphism
  \begin{align*}
    \theta\colon k[\{z_{ij} : 0\le i \le r,\ 0 \le j \le s\}] &\to
    k[x_0, \ldots, x_r, y_0, \ldots, y_s]\\
    z_{ij} &\mapsto x_iy_j
  \end{align*}
  and let $\mathfrak{a} = \ker\theta$. Note that $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime since
  $k[x_0, \ldots, x_r, y_0, \ldots, y_s]$ is a domain.
  %Then, $z_{ij} z_{kl} \mapsto x_iy_jx_ky_l$,
  %and $z_{kj}z_{il} \mapsto x_ky_jx_iy_l$. Thus, $\mathfrak{a} \supset
  %(z_{ij}z_{kl} - z_{kj}z_{il}:0\leq i,j \leq r,\ 0 \leq k,l \leq s)$.
  We claim that $\Im \psi = Z(\mathfrak{a})$. Let $P = (\ldots, a_ib_j,\ldots)
  \in \Im \psi$, and let $f \in \mathfrak{a}$. Then, $f(P) = (\theta f)(a,b) =
  0$, and so $P \in Z(\mathfrak{a})$, i.e., $\Im \psi \subset Z(\mathfrak{a})$.
  \par Conversely, suppose $Q = [\cdots:c_{ij}:\cdots] \in Z(\mathfrak{a})$.
  Fix $i_i,j_0$ such that $c_{i_0j_0} \ne 0$. We claim letting
  $a_i = c_{ij_0}$ and $b_j = c_{i_0j}$, we have
  $\psi(a,b) = Q$. First, note that
  \begin{equation*}
    \theta(z_{ij} z_{kl} - z_{kj}z_{il}) = x_iy_jx_ky_l - x_ky_jx_iy_l = 0,
  \end{equation*}
  hence $z_{ij} z_{kl} - z_{kj}z_{il} \in \mathfrak{a}$. Thus, 
  $a_ib_j = c_{ij_0}c_{i_0j} = c_{ij}c_{i_0j_0}$
  since $c_{ij_0}c_{i_0j} = c_{ij}c_{i_0j_0}$, and so $[\cdots:a_ib_j:\cdots] =
  [\cdots : c_{ij} : \cdots]$.
  %This for any generator $f = z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il}$ of $\mathfrak{a}$, $f(P) = 0 \Rightarrow \Im \psi \subseteq Z(\mathfrak{a})$. Conversely, let's show $Z(\mathfrak{a}) \subseteq \Im\psi \iff \mathfrak{a} \supset I(\Im\psi)$. If $g \in I(\Im \psi)$, then, for every $Q = (\cdots,a_ib_j, \cdots) \in \Im\psi$, $g(Q) = 0$. Then, $g \in \Ker \theta = \mathfrak{a}$.
  Finally, $Z(\mathfrak{a}) \subset \Im\psi$, and so 
  $\Im \psi = Z(\mathfrak{a})$. Moreover, this is a subvariety of $\PP^N$ since
  $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime, hence $Z(\mathfrak{a})$ is irreducible.
  %\par We remark that the $z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il}$ indeed generate
  %$\mathfrak{a}$. First, $\Im\psi = Z(z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il})$ by the above,
  %since $\Im \psi = Z(\mathfrak{a}) \subset Z(z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il})$ by the
  %fact that $z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il} \in \mathfrak{a}$, and since conversely,
  %$\Im\psi \supset Z(z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il})$ by the previous paragraph.
  %By Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(d)$, we therefore have $\mathfrak{a} =
  %\sqrt{(z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il})}$. $(z_{ij}z_{kl}-z_{kj}z_{il})$ is a
  %radical ideal since 
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[The Quadric Surface in $\PP^3$]
  Consider the surface $Q$ (a \emph{surface} is variety of dimension $2$) in
  $\PP^3$ defined by the equation $xy-zw = 0$.
  \begin{enuma} 
    \item Show that $Q$ is equal to the Segre embedding of $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$ in
      $\PP^3$, for suitable choice of coordinates.
    \item Show that $Q$ contains two families of lines (a \emph{line} is a
      linear variety of dimension $1$) $\{L_t\}, \{M_t\}$, each parametrized by
      $t \in \PP^1$, with the properties that if $L_t \ne L_u$, then
      $L_t \cap L_u = \emptyset$; if $M_t \ne M_u$, $M_t \cap M_u = \emptyset$,
      and for all $t,u, L_t \cap M_u =$ one point. 
    \item Show that $Q$ contains other curves besides these lines, and deduce that
      the Zariski topology on $Q$ is not homeomorphic via $\psi$ to the product
      topology on $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$ (where each $\PP^1$ has its Zariski
      topology). 
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  Let $Q = Z(xy - zw) \subset \PP^3$, where $\PP^3$ has coordinates $x,w,z,y$ in
  that order. Let $\theta\colon k[x,w,z,y] \to
  k[s,t,u,v]$ be the $k$-algebra homomorphism from Exercise \ref{exc:2.14},
  mapping $x \mapsto su,w \mapsto sv,z \mapsto tu,y \mapsto tv$. Then, the Segre
  embedding $\psi\colon\PP^1 \times \PP^1 \to \PP^3$ given by $[s : t] \times
  [u : v] \mapsto [su : sv : tu : tv]$ is such that $\Im\psi = Z(\ker\theta)$,
  and so we want to show $\ker\theta = (xy-zw)$. By definition
  of $\theta$, we have $\ker\theta \supset (xy-zw)$, and so it suffices to show
  the opposite inclusion. The proof of Exercise \ref{exc:2.14} shows that $Z(xy-zw)
  \subset Z(\ker\theta) = \Im\psi$ since every point in $\PP^3$ satisfying
  $xy-zw$ has preimage in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$; by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.3}(d)$ we
  then have $(xy-zw) \subset \ker\theta \subset \sqrt{(xy-zw)}$ and so it
  suffices to show $(xy-zw)$ is radical. But this is clear since it is generated
  by an irreducible quadratic polynomial, hence is prime, and in particular
  radical.
  %Let $Q = Z(xy -zw) \subset \PP^3$. From Exercise \ref{exc:2.14}, the Segre embedding of $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$ in $\PP^3= \{[z_{00}:z_{01}:z_{10}:z_{11}]\}$ is defined by $Z(z_{00}z_{11}-z_{10}z_{01})$. Thus, after change of coordinates (i.e. $z_{00} \mapsto x, z_{11} \mapsto y, z_{10} \mapsto z, z_{01} \mapsto w$) $Q$  equals to the Segre embedding of $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$ in $\PP^3$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  For $t = [a_0:a_1] \in \PP^1$, define $L_t,M_t$ to be
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    L_t &={}& \psi(\{t\} \times \PP^1) &= \{[a_0u : a_0v : a_1u : a_1v] \mid [u:v]
    \in \PP^1\}\\
    M_t &={}& \psi(\PP^1 \times \{t\}) &= \{[a_0u : a_1u : a_0v : a_1v] \mid [u:v]
    \in \PP^1\}
  \end{alignat*}
  Recall from $(a)$ that $\PP^3$ has coordinates $x,w,z,y$.
  $L_t$ is a linear variety, since $L_t = Z(a_1x - a_0z,a_1w - a_0y)$ by the
  proof of Exercise \ref{exc:2.14}. $L_t$ is one-dimensional since
  $[u:v] \mapsto [a_0u : a_0v : a_1u : a_1v]$ and 
  $[a_0u : a_0v : a_1u : a_1v] \mapsto [a_0u :a_0v] = [u:v]$ give a
  bijection between $L_t$ and $\PP^1$, which is moreover a homeomorphism because
  both maps are regular. Thus, $L_t$ is a line for each $t$.
  Similarly, $M_t = Z(a_1x - a_0w,a_1z - a_0y)$ is a line for each $t$.
  Since $\psi$ is a homeomorphism onto its image $Q$, if $L_t \ne L_u$, then
  $L_t \cap L_u = \emptyset$ and similarly if $M_t \ne M_u$, then $M_t \cap M_u =
  \emptyset$. Moreover, for all $t,u$, we see $L_t \cap M_u$ consists of one point.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(c)$]
  By our proof of Exercise $\ref{exc:2.9}(b)$, $Q$ contains the twisted cubic,
  since it is given by $Z(x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)$; this is not a line by Exercise
  $\ref{exc:2.11}(a)$. On the
  other hand, the closed subsets of $\PP^1$ are the empty set, finite sets of
  points, and all of $\PP^1$, and so the only closed subsets of $\PP^1 \times
  \PP^1$ in the product topology are the empty set, finite sets of points,
  finite sets of lines, and all of $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$. Thus, the Zariski
  topology on $Q$ is not homeomorphic via $\psi$ to the product topology on
  $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$.
  %Clearly, $Q$ contains other curves besides these lines: one example would be the curve contained in $Q$ defined by the equation $x = y$. This is closed in $Q$ but not in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$. Thus, the Zariski topology on $Q$ is not homeomorphic via $\psi$ to the product topology on $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem} \mbox{}
  \begin{enuma}
    \item The intersection of two varieties need not be a variety. For example,
      let $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ be the quadric surfaces in $\PP^3$ given by the
      equations $x^2-yw = 0$ and $xy - zw =0$, respectively. Show that $Q_1 \cap
      Q_2$ is the union of a twisted cubic curve and a line.
    \item Even if the intersection of two varieties is a variety, the ideal of the
      intersection may not be the sum of the ideals. For example, let $C$ be the
      conic in $\PP^2$ given by the equation $x^2-yz = 0$. Let $L$ be the line
      given by $y = 0$. Show that $C \cap L$ consists of one point $P$, but that
      $I(C) + I(L) \ne I(P)$. 
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  We claim $(x^2-yw,xy-zw) = (x,w) \cap (x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)$. $\subset$ is
  clear since every generator $x^2-yw,xy-zw$ is contained in $(x,w)$ and
  $(x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)$. Conversely, we know
  \begin{align*}
    &(x,w) \cap (x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)\\
    &\qquad= (x,w) \cap (x^2 - yw) + (x,w) \cap (xz - y^2) + (x,w) \cap (xy-zw)\\
    &\qquad= (x^2-yw,xy-zw) + (x,w) \cap (xz - y^2)
  \end{align*}
  by the modular law \cite[p.~6]{AM69}, hence it suffices to show the last
  summand is in $(x^2-yw,xy-zw)$. Note the elements of $(x,w) \cap (xz - y^2)$
  are elements of the form $f(xz - y^2) \in (x,w)$ for $f \in
  k[x,w,z,y]$; since $(x,w)$ is prime ($k[x,w,z,y]/(x,w) \cong k[z,y]$ is a
  domain), this implies $f \in (x,w)$, and so $f
  (xz - y^2) = gx(xz - y^2) + hw(xz - y^2)$ for some $g,h \in k[x,w,z,y]$. But,
  \begin{equation*}
    x(xz-y^2) = z(x^2 - yw) + y(xy - zw), \quad
    w(xz - y^2) = w(x^2 - yw) - x(xy - zw)
  \end{equation*}
  are both in $(x^2-yw,xy-zw)$, so we are done. Finally, we have
  \begin{align*}
    Q_1 \cap Q_2 &= Z(x^2-yw,xy-zw)\\
    &= Z((x,w) \cap (x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw))\\
    &= Z(\sqrt{(x,w) \cap (x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)})\\
    &= Z(\sqrt{(x,w) \cdot (x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)})\\
    &= Z((x,w) \cdot (x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw))\\
    &= Z(x,w) \cup Z(x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)
  \end{align*}
  since taking radicals for an ideal does not change the variety defined by its
  vanishing, $\sqrt{IJ} = \sqrt{I \cap J}$ by \cite[Exc.~1.13$iii$]{AM69}, and
  since $Z(I \cdot J) = Z(I) \cup Z(J)$ as in the proof of Prop.~1.1. $Z(x,w)$
  is a line and $Z(x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)$ is the twisted cubic by 
  Exercise $\ref{exc:2.11}(a)$.
  %Let $C =\{st^2:s^2t:s^3:t^3]$ be a twisted cubic (we changed the coordinate), and $L = \{[x,y,z,w]: x = w = 0\}$ be a line in $\PP^3$. We will show that $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = C \cup L$.
  %First consider when $w = 0$ Then, $x^2 -yw = 0 \iff x^2 = 0$ and $xy - zw =0 \iff xy =0$. Hence, $w = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0$. When, $w \neq 0$, we are in an affine patch $U = U_{w = 1}$, and in $U$, $x^2 -yw = 0$ and $xy -zw = 0$ becomes $x^2 = y, xy = z$. Thus, $U \cap (Q_1 \cap Q_2) = \{[x:x^2: x^3: 1]\}$, which is $C \cap U$. Thus, $C \cup L = (U \cap (Q_1 \cap Q_2)) \cup (U^c \cap (Q_1 \cap Q_2)) = Q_1 \cap Q_2$. Thus, $Q_1 \cap Q_2$ is the union of a twisted cubic curve and a line.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  $C \cap L = Z(x^2-yz,y) = Z(x^2,y) = Z(x,y) = \{P = [0:0:1]\}$ is one point,
  and $I(P) = \sqrt{(x,y)} = (x,y)$ since $(x,y)$ is prime hence radical.
  However, $I(C) = \sqrt{(x^2-yz)} = (x^2-yz)$ since $x^2-yz$ is irreducible
  hence the ideal it generates is prime and in particular radical, and $I(L) =
  y$, but $I(C) + I(L) = (x^2,y)$. 
  %If $x^2 - yz = 0, y =0$, then $x^2 =0 \iff x = 0$. Thus, $z = 1$ as $x,y,z$
  %cannot be all zero. Thus, $C \cap L$ consists of one point $P = [0:0:1]$
  %Thus, $I(P) = (x,y)$. $I(C) = x^2-yz$ (because $x^2-yz$ is irreducible),
  %$I(L) = y$. Thus, $I(C) + I(L) = (x^2, y)$. Obviously,
  $(x^2,y) \ne (x,y)$ since $x \in (x,y)\setminus(x^2,y)$.

\begin{problem}[Complete intersections]
  A variety $Y$ of dimension $r$ in $\PP^n$ is a \emph{(strict) complete
  intersection} if $I(Y)$ can be generated by $n-r$ elements. $Y$ is a
  \emph{set-theoretic complete intersection} if $Y$ can be written as the
  intersection of $n-r$ hypersurfaces.
  \begin{enuma}
    \item Let $Y$ be a variety in $\PP^n$, let $Y = Z(\mathfrak{a})$; and
      suppose that $\mathfrak{a}$ can be generated by $q$ elements. Then show
      that $\dim Y \ge n-q$. 
    \item Show that a strict complete intersection is a set-theoretic complete
      intersection.
    \item The converse of $(b)$ is false. For example let $Y$ be the twisted
      cubic curve in $\PP^3$ \hyperref[exc:2.9]{\emph{(Ex.\ 2.9)}}. Show that
      $I(Y)$ cannot be generated by two elements. On the other hand, find
      hypersurfaces $H_1,H_2$ of degrees $2,3$ respectively, such that
      $Y = H_1 \cap H_2$. 
    \item It is an unsolved problem whether every closed irreducible curve in
      $\PP^3$ is a set-theoretic intersection of two surfaces.
  \end{enuma}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(a)$]
  Let $Y = Z(\mathfrak{a})$ be a variety in $\PP^n$ where $\mathfrak{a}$ can be
  generated by $q$ elements. Then, its affine cone $CY$ has dimension $\ge n + 1 -
  q$ by Exercise $1.9$. By Exercise $\ref{exc:2.10}(c)$, we then have 
  $\dim Y \ge n - q$.
  %We use induction on $q$ to show that $\dim Y \geq n-q$.
  %If $q = 1$, this is Exercise \ref{exc:2.8}.
  %\par So assume that the result is true for $q = r$. Now, $\mathfrak{a} = (e_1,
  %\ldots, e_r, e_{r+1})$ where $e_{r+1} \notin (e_1, \ldots, e_r)$. Let $Y' =
  %Z(e_1, \ldots, e_r)$; by induction hypothesis, $\dim Y' \ge n-r$. From
  %Exercise 1.8, $\dim Y = \dim (Y' \cap Z(e_{r+1})) \geq n-r-1 = n-(r+1)$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(b)$]
  Assume that an $r$-dimensional variety $Y \subset \PP^n$ is a strict complete
  intersection, so $I(Y) = (f_1, \ldots, f_{n-r})$.
  Then, $Y = Z(f_1) \cap \cdots \cap Z(f_{n-r})$ as in the proof of
  Prop.~1.1. Hence, $Y$ is a set-theoretic complete intersection. 
  %$x \in Y \iff f_i(x) = 0 $ for all $i = 1, \cdots, n-r \iff$ $x \in \cap Z(f_i)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of $(c)$]
  Let $Y = Z(x^2-yw,xz-y^2,xy-zw)$ be the twisted cubic curve in $\PP^3$. Then,
  $I(Y) = (xz-y^2, yw-z^2, xw-yz)$ since this ideal is radical by our proof of
  Exercise $\ref{exc:2.9}(b)$, and is moreover prime. However, $I(Y)$ cannot be
  generated by two elements, since considering $(I(Y))_2$ as a $k$-vector space,
  $xz-y^2, yw-z^2, xw-yz$ are linearly independent.
  %Then, $Y = Z(xz-y^2, yw-z^2, xw-yz)$, and $(xz-y^2, yw-z^2, xw-yz)$ is a radical ideal. $I(Y)=(xz-y^2, yw-z^2, xw-yz)$ cannot be generated by any of the two polynomials $f,g \in k[x,y,z,w]$: if so, $xw-yz \in (xz-y^2, yw-z^2)$ but it is easy to check that this is not true (exercise 1.11).
  \par However, let $H_1 = Z(x^2-yw)$ and $H_2 = Z(z(xy-zw)+y(xz-y^2))$. We
  claim that $H_1 \cap H_2 = Y$. It suffices to show
  $\sqrt{(x^2-yw,z(xy-zw)+y(xz-y^2))} = I(Y)$ by Exercise $\ref{exc:2.4}(a)$.
  Since $(x^2-yw,z(xy-zw)+y(xz-y^2)) \subset I(Y)$ trivially, it only remains to
  show $I(Y) \subset \sqrt{(x^2-yw,z(xy-zw)+y(xz-y^2))}$. But
  \begin{alignat*}{7}
    (xz-y^2)^2 &={}& x^2z^2 &-{}& 2xy^2z &{}+ y^4 &{}={}& z^2(x^2-yw) &{}-{}&
    y(z(xy-zw)&{}+{}&y(xz-y^2))\\
    (xy-zw)^2 &={}& x^2y^2 &-{}& 2xyzw &{}+ z^2w^2 &{}={}& y^2(x^2-yw) &{}-{}&
    w(z(xy-zw)&{}+{}&y(xz-y^2))
  \end{alignat*}
  and so $I(Y) \subset \sqrt{(x^2-yw,z(xy-zw)+y(xz-y^2))}$, so that
  $H_1 \cap H_2 = Y$. Thus, the converse of $(b)$ is false.
  %\par However, we can find hypersurfaces $H_1, H_2$ of degrees 2, 3 respectively, such that $Y = H_1 \cap H_2$. Let $H_1 = Z(z^2-yw)$ and $H_2 = Z(y^3-2xyz+x^2w)$. Then, $H_1 \cap H_2 = Z(\sqrt{(z^2-yw, y^3-2xyz+x^2w)})$. We can easily check (by Macaulay or easily by hand) that $\sqrt{(z^2-yw, y^3-2xyz+x^2w)} = (xz-y^2, yw-z^2, xw-yz)$. Hence, $H_1 \cap H_2 = Y$. Hence the converse of $(b)$ is false.
